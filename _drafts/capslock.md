The Capslock Problem
====================

Recently some developers and I had an interesting discussion about the
value of the venerable capslock key. The debate wasn't particularly
heated since it was kind of a side note to a larger flame war that was
ongoing. The debate centered around whether or not it is a good idea
to turn capslock into an extra control key. Two distinct opinions
bubbled to the top.

* I use capslock more frequently than other keys that take up keyboard
  space.
* Capslock is redundant with the two shift keys and is in a really
  convenient place for a control key.

A third less popular opinion was "who ever uses the shift key?"

I come down squarely on the side capslock being replaced with a
control key. However, instead of spending too much time rehashing the
(indisputable) facts about why capslock is a dumb key and should be
replaced on all keyboards (see [Chromebooks][chromebook-help] for a
popular example of this actually happening), I decided that I would
spend my time here explaining how to actually make the change on
various platforms.

Justification
-------------

I would like to spend just a second explaining why you would want to
do this. Here are some convenient links in case you want to skip right
to instructions for your platform of choice: <a href="#osx">OS X</a>,
<a href="#linux">Linux, <a href="#windows">Windows</a>.

\*DISCLAIMER\*
Most of this is hearsay, speculation, and pure trolling. The rest is
100% the opinion of the author and possibly no one else.

Also, I didn't use capslock to type "DISCLAIMER."
\*END DISCLAIMER\*

Literally no one uses the capslock key for any reasonable purpose. My
experience suggests that anyone who does use capslock is either
yelling at people on the internet or being lazy. One possible
exception that I've seen is a particular typist exclusive using
capslock instead of shift. I can't explain this anomoly and I've only
seen it once. Suffice it to say, this person probably needs
psychological help.

Before I get too far into this I should probably admit something. A
big part of my justification stems from being an avid Emacs
user. Emacs is heavily dependent on the control key
([although it doesn't have to be][evil-mode]).
